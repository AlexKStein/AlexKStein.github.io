                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <hr> <br>
                    <p> My name is Alex Stein, and this is my portfolio website for my work as a full-stack web & software developer. 
                        I am currently a student at We Can Code IT, and the projects below were created during my time there. 
                        In time, as I continue to work on newer and more exciting projects, and learning everything I can along the way, so will my projects section from these new and exciting endeavors.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe that everything is learning opportunity, and that I will always grow when following the infamous advice of Jedi Master Yoda, ""Do, or do not. There is no
                        try." If I approach a challenge with the mindset that I'm going to try, then I don't have the mindset of success and growth. 
                        Failure is the best teacher, but only when you're trying to succeed.
                        <br><br>
                        Through a life full of hard work and a love of learning, I've learned a great many things; most importantly is that I basically know nothing in the grand scheme of things.
